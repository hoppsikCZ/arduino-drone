# Drone-Arduino Project

This project aims to connect a drone with an Arduino board to enable remote control and automation. The Arduino acts as an interface, sending commands to the drone and receiving telemetry data. The goal is to implement functions that the Betaflight firmware doesn't provide.

**Note:** This is an experimental attempt.

## Features

- Arduino-based drone control
- Communication between Arduino and drone
- Customizable commands and automation
- Uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for development
- Utilizes the [ReefwingMSP](https://github.com/Reefwing-Software/ReefwingMSP) library for MSP protocol communication

## Requirements

- Arduino board
- Compatible drone
- Connection cables
- PlatformIO installed
- ReefwingMSP library
